# Minimal Content Design

Content strategy for high-impact websites. Less text, more impact.

## Core Principles

1. **One headline per section** - Maximum impact
2. **Six words or less** - Headlines must be scannable
3. **Show, don't tell** - Use visuals instead of explanations
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Details on click, not on load
5. **Every word fights for its life** - Delete half, then half again

## Content Hierarchy

### Hero Section
```
[Optional: Small label]
MASSIVE HEADLINE (4-6 words)
[Optional: One short sentence]
[Primary CTA]
```

### Feature Section
```
[Label]
HEADLINE (4-6 words)
[One sentence description]
[Visual]
```

### Stats Section
```
NUMBER
Label (1-2 words)
```

## Writing Rules

### Headlines
- Maximum 6 words
- No articles (a, an, the) if possible
- Active voice
- Specific, not generic

**Good:**
- "Molecular precision."
- "Lab-tested purity."
- "Zero compromises."

**Bad:**
- "We provide the best protein powder"
- "Our product is scientifically formulated"
- "Experience the difference today"

### Subtitles
- Maximum 12 words
- Expands on headline, doesn't repeat
- One sentence only

**Good:**
- "Every batch tested for heavy metals and purity."
- "25g protein. 2.8g leucine. Zero fillers."

**Bad:**
- "Our revolutionary formula uses advanced scientific processes to deliver..."

### Labels
- 1-3 words
- All caps
- Tracks user location

**Examples:**
- THE SCIENCE
- THE STORY
- THE PRODUCT

## Content Density by Section

| Section Type | Headline | Subtitle | Body | Visual |
|-------------|----------|----------|------|--------|
| Hero | 1 | 0-1 | 0 | 0-1 |
| Feature | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Stats | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Story | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Product | 1 | 1 | 0-3 bullets | 1 |

## Visual Alternatives to Text

Instead of writing:
- Use icons with labels
- Use animated diagrams
- Use data visualizations
- Use product shots
- Use abstract motion graphics

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Paragraphs on landing sections
❌ Bullet points explaining features
❌ Multiple headlines competing
❌ Generic marketing language
❌ "Learn more" without clear value
