# Polish Phase Workflow

**Status:** Active | **Enforced for all builds**

---

## Rule

**NEVER skip phases. NEVER finish early.**

All 5 phases must be completed. All 5 quality gates must pass.

---

## The 5 Phases

### PHASE 1 – Base Build
- [ ] Full working static site
- [ ] Functional animations
- [ ] Clean layout

### PHASE 2 – Brutal Self-Critique
- [ ] Identify generic elements
- [ ] Identify weak sections
- [ ] Identify visual imbalance
- [ ] Identify overused patterns

### PHASE 3 – Refinement Pass
- [ ] Improve typography hierarchy
- [ ] Improve spacing rhythm
- [ ] Reduce visual noise
- [ ] Make animations subtler, more intentional

### PHASE 4 – Uniqueness Injection
- [ ] Add 2+ custom signature interactions
- [ ] Add recognizable visual motif
- [ ] Ensure no template resemblance

### PHASE 5 – Final Polish
- [ ] Remove unnecessary elements
- [ ] Improve transitions
- [ ] Improve micro-interactions
- [ ] Optimize performance

## Quality Gates (ALL must pass)

| Gate | Question |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Would this look at home on Awwwards? |
| 2 | Would a designer screenshot this? |
| 3 | Does it have a recognizable identity? |
| 4 | Does it avoid common template layouts? |
| 5 | Is the hero memorable after 5 seconds? |

**If any answer is "no" → Continue refining.**

QUALITY GATES
1. Awwwards worthy? [yes/no]
2. Screenshot worthy? [yes/no]
3. Recognizable identity? [yes/no]
4. No template resemblance? [yes/no]
5. Memorable hero? [yes/no]

STATUS: [PASS / CONTINUE REFINING]
```

## No Simulated Time

- Never fabricate ETAs
- Never fabricate percentages
- Never role-play build timers
- Only report real execution time measured from actual command start
- If time cannot be measured: state "Time cannot be measured"

## Integration

This workflow supersedes all other workflows for visual builds.
