Subject: Your cinnamon rolls are calling my name

Hey!

I am Marwa, and I have to tell you — your cinnamon rolls look absolutely ridiculous (in the best way). I have been staring at your Instagram for way too long.

But I gotta be honest... when I clicked over to your website, I was kind of bummed. It does not match the energy of your shop at all. Where is the personality? The warmth? The "we make dough" attitude?

I build websites for bakeries, and I think I could help you out. Even my basic package ($250) has smooth animations and hover effects — way better than what you have now. But honestly? The sweet spot is my Signature package ($500). That is where we add parallax scrolling, staggered animations, and make it feel like walking into your shop.

Want to see what I am talking about? I can mock something up in 24 hours, no strings attached.

Your cinnamon rolls deserve a website that makes people drive across town.
