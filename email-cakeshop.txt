Subject: Those wedding cakes though

Hi there!

Okay, I have to confess — I have been stalking your cake gallery. Those wedding cakes? Absolutely stunning. You can tell there is real artistry there.

But then I saw your website and... ouch. It does not do your work justice at all. Static, generic, feels like a template from 2010.

I am a web developer who specializes in bakery sites, and I would love to help. My Launch package ($250) gets you smooth animations and a clean look. But where it gets really good is Signature ($500) — that is where we add parallax scrolling, beautiful galleries, and make your site feel as premium as your cakes.

Most of my bakery clients go with Signature. It is the "holy crap, who built your site?" level.

Want to see what that could look like for you? Happy to throw together a free mockup.

Those cakes deserve better.
